So you want to build your own Traefik binary from the sources? Let's see how. Building \u00b6 You need either Docker and make (Method 1), or go (Method 2) in order to build Traefik. For changes to its dependencies, the dep dependency management tool is required. Method 1: Using Docker and Makefile \u00b6 Run make with the binary target. This will create binaries for the Linux platform in the dist folder. $ make binary docker build -t traefik-webui -f webui/Dockerfile webui Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.686MB Step 1/11 : FROM node:8.15.0 ---> 1f6c34f7921c [...] Successfully built ce4ff439c06a Successfully tagged traefik-webui:latest [...] docker build -t \"traefik-dev:4475--feature-documentation\" -f build.Dockerfile .

Source Directory It is recommended that you clone Traefik into the ~/go/src/github.com/containous/traefik directory. This is the official golang workspace hierarchy that will allow dependencies to be properly resolved. Environment Set your GOPATH and PATH variable to be set to ~/go via: export GOPATH=~/go export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin For convenience, add GOPATH and PATH to your .bashrc or .bash_profile Verify your environment is setup properly by running $ go env . Depending on your OS and environment, you should see an output similar to: GOARCH=\"amd64\" GOBIN=\"\" GOEXE=\"\" GOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\" GOHOSTOS=\"linux\" GOOS=\"linux\" GOPATH=\"/home/<yourusername>/go\" GORACE=\"\" ## ... and the list goes on Build Traefik \u00b6 Once you've set up your go environment and cloned the source repository, you can build Traefik. Beforehand, you need to get go-bindata (the first time) in order to be able to use the go generate command (which is part of the build process). cd ~/go/src/github.com/containous/traefik # Get go-bindata. (Important: the ellipses are required.) go get github.com/containous/go-bindata/... # Let's build # generate # (required to merge non-code components into the final binary, such as the web dashboard and the provider's templates) go generate # Standard go build go build ./cmd/traefik You will find the Traefik executable ( traefik ) in the ~/go/src/github.com/containous/traefik directory. Updating the templates \u00b6 If you happen to update the provider's templates (located in /templates ), you must run go generate to update the autogen package. Setting up dependency management \u00b6 The dep command is not required for building; however, it is necessary if you need to update the dependencies (i.e., add, update, or remove third-party packages). You need dep >= 0.5.0. If you want to add a dependency, use dep ensure -add to have dep put it into the vendor folder and update the dep manifest/lock files ( Gopkg.toml and Gopkg.lock , respectively). A following make dep-prune run should be triggered to trim down the size of the vendor folder. The final result must be committed into VCS. Here's a full example using dep to add a new dependency: # install the new main dependency github.com/foo/bar and minimize vendor size $ dep ensure -add github.com/foo/bar # generate (Only required to integrate other components such as web dashboard) $ go generate # Standard go build $ go build ./cmd/traefik Testing \u00b6 Method 1: Docker and make \u00b6 Run unit tests using the test-unit target.

The dynamic configuration contains everything that defines how the requests are handled by your system. This configuration can change and is seamlessly hot-reloaded, without any request interuption or connection loss. The Dynamic Configuration \u00b6 Traefik gets its dynamic configuration from providers : wether an orchestrator, a service registry, or a plain old configuration file. Since this configuration is specific to your infrastructure choices, we invite you to refer to the dedicated section of this documentation . Note In the Quick Start example , the dynamic configuration comes from docker in the form of labels attached to your containers. Note HTTPS Certificates also belong to the dynamic configuration. You can add / update / remove them without restarting your Traefik instance. The Static Configuration \u00b6 There are three different locations where you can define static configuration options in Traefik: In a key-value store In the command-line arguments In a configuration file If you don't provide a value for a given option, default values apply. Precedence Order The following precedence order applies for configuration options: key-value > command-line > configuration file. It means that arguments override configuration file, and key-value store overrides arguments. Default Values Some root options are enablers: they set default values for all their children. For example, the --providers.docker option enables the docker provider. Once positioned, this option sets (and resets) all the default values under the root providers.docker . If you define child options using a lesser precedence configuration source, they will be overwritten by the default values. Configuration File \u00b6 At startup, Traefik searches for a file named traefik.toml in /etc/traefik/ , $HOME/.traefik/ , and . ( the working directory ). You can override this using the configFile argument. traefik --configFile=foo/bar/myconfigfile.toml Arguments \u00b6 Use traefik --help to get the list of the available arguments. Key-Value Stores \u00b6 Traefik supports several Key-value stores: Consul etcd ZooKeeper boltdb Available Configuration Options \u00b6 All the configuration options are documented in their related section.

When your system is healthy, the circuit is close (normal operations). When your system becomes unhealthy, the circuit becomes open and the requests are no longer forwarded (but handled by a fallback mechanism). To assess if your system is healthy, the circuit breaker constantly monitors the services. Note The CircuitBreaker only analyses what happens after it is positioned in the middleware chain. What happens before has no impact on its state. The CircuitBreaker only affects the routers that use it. Routers that don't use the CircuitBreaker won't be affected by its state. Important Each router will eventually gets its own instance of a given circuit breaker. If two different routers refer to the same circuit breaker definition, they will get one instance each. It means that one circuit breaker can be open while the other stays close: their state is not shared. This is the expected behavior, we want you to be able to define what makes a service healthy without having to declare a circuit breaker for each route. Configuration Examples \u00b6 Latency Check -- Using Toml [middlewares] [middlewares.latency-check.circuitbreaker] expression = \"LatencyAtQuantileMS(50.0) > 100\" Latency Check -- Using Docker Labels # in a docker compose file container-definition: image: image-name labels: - \"traefik.middlewares.latency-check.circuitbreaker.expression=LatencyAtQuantileMS(50.0) > 100\" Possible States \u00b6 There are three possible states for your circuit breaker: Close (your service operates normally) Open (the fallback mechanism takes over your service) Recovering (the circuit breaker tries to resume normal operations by progressively sending requests to your service) Close \u00b6 While close, the circuit breaker only collects metrics to analyze the behavior of the requests. At specified intervals ( checkPeriod ), it will evaluate expression to decide if its state must change. Open \u00b6 While open, the fallback mechanism takes over the normal service calls for a duration of FallbackDuration . After this duration, it will enter the recovering state. Recovering \u00b6 While recovering, the circuit breaker will progressively send requests to your service again (in a linear way, for RecoveryDuration ). If your service fails during recovery, the circuit breaker becomes open again. If the service operates normally during the whole recovering duration, then the circuit breaker returns to close. Configuration Options \u00b6 Configuring the Trigger \u00b6 You can specify an expression that, once matched, will trigger the circuit breaker (and apply the fallback mechanism instead of calling your services). The expression can check three different metrics: The network error ratio ( NetworkErrorRatio ) The status code ratio ( ResponseCodeRatio ) The latency at quantile, in milliseconds ( LatencyAtQuantileMS ) NetworkErrorRatio \u00b6 If you want the circuit breaker to trigger at a 30% ratio of network errors, the expression will be NetworkErrorRatio() > 0.30 ResponseCodeRatio \u00b6 You can trigger the circuit breaker based on the ratio of a given range of status codes. The ResponseCodeRatio accepts four parameters, from , to , dividedByFrom , dividedByTo . The operation that will be computed is sum( to -> from ) / sum ( dividedByFrom -> dividedByTo ). Note If sum ( dividedByFrom -> dividedByTo ) equals 0, then ResponseCodeRatio returns 0. from is inclusive, to is exclusive. For example, the expression ResponseCodeRatio(500, 600, 0, 600) > 0.25 will trigger the circuit breaker if 25% of the requests returned a 5XX status (amongst the request that returned a status code from 0 to 5XX). LatencyAtQuantileMS \u00b6 You can trigger the circuit breaker when a given proportion of your requests become too slow. For example, the expression LatencyAtQuantileMS(50.0) > 100 will trigger the circuit breaker when the median lantency (quantile 50) reaches 100MS. Note You must provide a float number (with the leading .0) for the quantile value Using multiple metrics \u00b6 You can combine multiple metrics using operators in your expression. Supported operators are: AND ( && ) OR (`||) For example, ResponseCodeRatio(500, 600, 0, 600) > 0.30 || NetworkErrorRatio() > 0.10 triggers the circuit breaker when 30% of the requests return a 5XX status code, or when the ratio of network errors reaches 10%. Operators \u00b6 Here is the list of supported operators: Greater than ( > ) Greater or equal than ( >= ) Lesser than ( < ) Lesser or equal than ( <= ) Not ( ! ) Equal ( == ) Not Equal ( != ) Fallback mechanism \u00b6 The fallback mechanism returns a HTTP 503 Service Unavailable to the client (instead of calling the target service). This behavior cannot be configured. CheckPeriod \u00b6 The interval used to evaluate expression and decide if the state of the circuit breaker must change. By default, CheckPeriod is 100Ms. This value cannot be configured. FallbackDuration \u00b6 By default, FallbackDuration is 10 seconds. This value cannot be configured. RecoveringDuration \u00b6 The duration of the recovering mode (recovering state). By default, RecoveringDuration is 10 seconds. This value cannot be configured.","title":"CircuitBreaker"},{"location":"middlewares/circuitbreaker/#circuitbreaker","text":"Don't Waste Time Calling Unhealthy Services The circuit breaker protects your system from stacking requests to unhealthy services (resulting in cascading failures).

When used in conjunction with the traefik.port label (that tells Traefik to route requests to a specific port), Traefik tries to find a binding on port traefik.port . If it can't find such a binding, Traefik falls back on the internal network IP of the container, but still uses the traefik.port that is set in the label.

Routing Configuration Options \u00b6 General \u00b6 Traefik creates, for each container, a corresponding service and router . The Service automatically gets a server per instance of the container, and the router gets a default rule attached to it, based on the container name. Routers \u00b6 To update the configuration of the Router automatically attached to the container, add labels starting with traefik.routers.{name-of-your-choice}. and followed by the option you want to change. For example, to change the rule, you could add the label traefik.routers.my-container.rule=Host(my-domain) . Every Router parameter can be updated this way. Services \u00b6 To update the configuration of the Service automatically attached to the container, add labels starting with traefik.services.{name-of-your-choice}. , followed by the option you want to change. For example, to change the load balancer method, you'd add the label traefik.services.{name-of-your-choice}.loadbalancer.method=drr . Every Service parameter can be updated this way. Middleware \u00b6 You can declare pieces of middleware using labels starting with traefik.middlewares.{name-of-your-choice}. , followed by the middleware type/options. For example, to declare a middleware schemeredirect named my-redirect , you'd write traefik.middlewares.my-redirect.schemeredirect.scheme: https . Declaring and Referencing a Middleware services: my-container: # ... labels: - traefik.middlewares.my-redirect.schemeredirect.scheme=https - traefik.routers.middlewares=my-redirect Conflicts in Declaration If you declare multiple middleware with the same name but with different parameters, the middleware fails to be declared. Specific Options \u00b6 traefik.enable \u00b6 You can tell Traefik to consider (or not) the container by setting traefik.enable to true or false. This option overrides the value of exposedByDefault . traefik.tags \u00b6 Sets the tags for constraints filtering . traefik.docker.network \u00b6 Overrides the default docker network to use for connections to the container. If a container is linked to several networks, be sure to set the proper network name (you can check this with docker inspect <container_id> ), otherwise it will randomly pick one (depending on how docker is returning them).

Configuration Options \u00b6 The Different ACME Challenges \u00b6 tlsChallenge \u00b6 Use the TLS-ALPN-01 challenge to generate and renew ACME certificates by provisioning a TLS certificate. Using an EntryPoint Called https for the tlsChallenge [acme] # ... entryPoint = \"https\" [acme.tlsChallenge] Note As described on the Let's Encrypt community forum , when using the TLS-ALPN-01 challenge, acme.entryPoint must be reachable by Let's Encrypt through port 443. httpChallenge \u00b6 Use the HTTP-01 challenge to generate and renew ACME certificates by provisioning an HTTP resource under a well-known URI. Using an EntryPoint Called http for the httpChallenge [acme] # ... entryPoint = \"https\" [acme.httpChallenge] entryPoint = \"http\" Note As described on the Let's Encrypt community forum , when using the HTTP-01 challenge, acme.httpChallenge.entryPoint must be reachable by Let's Encrypt through port 80. Note Redirection is fully compatible with the HTTP-01 challenge. dnsChallenge \u00b6 Use the DNS-01 challenge to generate and renew ACME certificates by provisioning a DNS record.

You can delay this operation by specifying a delay (in seconds) with delayBeforeCheck (value must be greater than zero). This option is useful when internal networks block external DNS queries. resolvers Use custom DNS servers to resolve the FQDN authority. [acme] # ... [acme.dnsChallenge] # ... resolvers = [\"1.1.1.1:53\", \"8.8.8.8:53\"] Known Domains, SANs, and Wildcards \u00b6 You can set SANs (alternative domains) for each main domain. Every domain must have A/AAAA records pointing to Traefik. Each domain & SAN will lead to a certificate request. [acme] # ... [[acme.domains]] main = \"local1.com\" sans = [\"test1.local1.com\", \"test2.local1.com\"] [[acme.domains]] main = \"local2.com\" [[acme.domains]] main = \"*.local3.com\" sans = [\"local3.com\", \"test1.test1.local3.com\"] # ... Important The certificates for the domains listed in acme.domains are negotiated at Traefik startup only. Note Wildcard certificates can only be verified through a DNS-01 challenge. Wildcard Domains \u00b6 ACME V2 supports wildcard certificates. As described in Let's Encrypt's post wildcard certificates can only be generated through a DNS-01 challenge . [acme] # ... [[acme.domains]] main = \"*.local1.com\" sans = [\"local1.com\"] # ... Double Wildcard Certificates It is not possible to request a double wildcard certificate for a domain (for example *.*.local.com ). Due to an ACME limitation it is not possible to define wildcards in SANs (alternative domains). Thus, the wildcard domain has to be defined as a main domain. Most likely the root domain should receive a certificate too, so it needs to be specified as SAN and 2 DNS-01 challenges are executed. In this case the generated DNS TXT record for both domains is the same. Even though this behavior is DNS RFC compliant, it can lead to problems as all DNS providers keep DNS records cached for a given time (TTL) and this TTL can be greater than the challenge timeout making the DNS-01 challenge fail. The Traefik ACME client library LEGO supports some but not all DNS providers to work around this issue. The Supported provider table indicates if they allow generating certificates for a wildcard domain and its root domain. caServer \u00b6 Using the Let's Encrypt staging server [acme] # ... caServer = \"https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory\" # ... onHostRule \u00b6 Enable certificate generation on routers Host rules (for routers active on the acme.entryPoint ). This will request a certificate from Let's Encrypt for each router with a Host rule. [acme] # ... onHostRule = true # ... Multiple Hosts in a Rule The rule Host(test1.traefik.io,test2.traefik.io) will request a certificate with the main domain test1.traefik.io and SAN test2.traefik.io . Warning onHostRule option can not be used to generate wildcard certificates. Refer to wildcard generation for further information. storage \u00b6 The storage option sets the location where your ACME certificates are saved to. [acme] # ... storage = \"acme.json\" # ... The value can refer to two kinds of storage: a JSON file a KV store entry In a File \u00b6 ACME certificates can be stored in a JSON file that needs to have a 600 file mode . In Docker you can mount either the JSON file, or the folder containing it: docker run -v \"/my/host/acme.json:acme.json\" traefik docker run -v \"/my/host/acme:/etc/traefik/acme\" traefik Warning For concurrency reason, this file cannot be shared across multiple instances of Traefik. Use a key value store entry instead. In a a Key Value Store Entry \u00b6 ACME certificates can be stored in a key-value store entry. storage = \"traefik/acme/account\" Storage Size Because key-value stores have limited entry size, the certificates list is compressed before it is saved. For example, it is possible to store up to approximately 100 ACME certificates in Consul. Fallbacks \u00b6 If Let's Encrypt is not reachable, the following certificates will apply: Previously generated ACME certificates (before downtime) Expired ACME certificates Provided certificates Note For new (sub)domains which need Let's Encrypt authentification, the default Traefik certificate will be used until Traefik is restarted.","title":"ACME"},{"location":"routing/acme/#acme","text":"Automatic HTTPS Traefik can automatically generate certificates for your domains using an ACME provider (like Let's Encrypt).

We could have written entryPoints.foo and entryPoints.bar instead. Automatic HTTPS with ACME If you don't have certificate files and wish to automatically enable HTTPS, you should have a look at one of Traefik's most praised feature: ACME & Let's Encrypt integration Client Certificate Authentication [entryPoints] [entryPoints.https] address = \":443\" [entryPoints.https.tls] [entryPoints.https.tls.ClientCA] files = [\"tests/clientca1.crt\", \"tests/clientca2.crt\"] optional = false [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]] certFile = \"tests/traefik.crt\" keyFile = \"tests/traefik.key\" We enabled SSL on https by giving it a certificate and a key. Files containing Certificate Authorities (PEM format) were added. Multiple CAs It is possible to have multiple CA:s in the same file or keep them in separate files. Configuration \u00b6 General \u00b6 Entrypoints are part of the static configuration . You can define them using a toml file, CLI arguments, or a key-value store. See the complete reference for the list of available options. Using the CLI Here is an example of using the CLI to define entrypoints : --entryPoints='Name:http Address::80' --entryPoints='Name:https Address::443 TLS' Note The whitespace character ( ) is the option separator, and the comma ( , ) is the value separator for lists. The option names are case-insensitive. Using Docker Compose Files The syntax for passing arguments inside a docker compose file is a little different. Here are two examples. traefik: image: traefik command: - --defaultentrypoints=powpow - \"--entryPoints=Name:powpow Address::42 Compress:true\" or traefik: image: traefik command: --defaultentrypoints=powpow --entryPoints='Name:powpow Address::42 Compress:true' TLS \u00b6 Static Certificates \u00b6 To add SNI support, define certFile and keyFile . [entryPoints] [entryPoints.https] address = \":443\" [entryPoints.https.tls] [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]] certFile = \"integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.cert\" keyFile = \"integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.key\" Note If you provide an empty TLS configuration, default self-signed certificates will be generated. Dynamic Certificates \u00b6 To add / remove TLS certificates while Traefik is running, the file provider supports Dynamic TLS certificates in its [[tls]] section. Mutual Authentication \u00b6 Traefik supports both optional and non optional (defaut value) mutual authentication. When optional = false , Traefik accepts connections only from client presenting a certificate signed by a CA listed in ClientCA.files . When optional = true , Traefik authorizes connections from client presenting a certificate signed by an unknown CA. Non Optional Mutual Authentication In the following example, both snitest.com and snitest.org will require client certificates. [entryPoints] [entryPoints.https] address = \":443\" [entryPoints.https.tls] [entryPoints.https.tls.ClientCA] files = [\"tests/clientca1.crt\", \"tests/clientca2.crt\"] optional = false [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]] certFile = \"integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.cert\" keyFile = \"integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.key\" [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]] certFile = \"integration/fixtures/https/snitest.org.cert\" keyFile = \"integration/fixtures/https/snitest.org.key\" ClientCA.files You can use a file per CA:s , or a single file containing multiple CA:s (in PEM format). ClientCA.files is not optional: every client will have to present a valid certificate. (This requirement will apply to every server certificate declared in the entrypoint.) Minimum TLS Version \u00b6 Min TLS version & cipherSuites [entryPoints] [entryPoints.https] address = \":443\" [entryPoints.https.tls] minVersion = \"VersionTLS12\" cipherSuites = [ \"TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\", \"TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\" ] [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]] certFile = \"integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.cert\" keyFile = \"integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.key\" [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]] certFile = \"integration/fixtures/https/snitest.org.cert\" keyFile = \"integration/fixtures/https/snitest.org.key\" Strict SNI Checking \u00b6 With strict SNI checking, Traefik won't allow connections without a matching certificate. Strict SNI [entryPoints] [entryPoints.https] address = \":443\" [entryPoints.https.tls] sniStrict = true [[entryPoints.https.tls.certificates]] certFile = \"integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.cert\" keyFile = \"integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.key\" Default Certificate \u00b6 Traefik can use a default certificate for connections without an SNI, or without a matching domain. If no default certificate is provided, Traefik generates a self-signed and use it instead. Setting a Default Certificate [entryPoints] [entryPoints.https] address = \":443\" [entryPoints.https.tls] [entryPoints.https.tls.defaultCertificate] certFile = \"integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.cert\" keyFile = \"integration/fixtures/https/snitest.com.key\" Only One Default Certificate There can only be one defaultCertificate per entrypoint. ProxyProtocol \u00b6 Traefik supports ProxyProtocol . Enabling Proxy Protocol with Trusted IPs [entryPoints] [entryPoints.http] address = \":80\" [entryPoints.http.proxyProtocol] trustedIPs = [\"127.0.0.1/32\", \"192.168.1.7\"] IPs in trustedIPs only will lead to remote client address replacement: Declare load-balancer IPs or CIDR range here.
